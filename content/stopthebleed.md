**[stopthebleed.org](https://www.stopthebleed.org)** and **[Bleeding Control
Kits®](https://deepwaterhappy.com/2019/04/11/finding-a-good-bleeding-control-kit-for-your-office-or-classroom/)**
 provide the tools and information you need to act quickly to stop
traumatic blood loss.

professionals, first responders and general citizens in serious trauma
emergencies. A fast response along with an easy, recognizable access
to equipment is imperative to "Stop the Bleed".  Response Ready Inc. is

public education will be as prevalent as public AED's, in serving a vital
purpose in the preservation of life in the emergency bleeding scenario.
